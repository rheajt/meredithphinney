Gurr's (2017) study is beneficial in specifically disseminating how school leadership affects student learning and allows us to understand better what \"success\" means in this context. It is helpful to understand the definition of success that Gurr (2017) identifies to further our understanding of the part that principals may or may not play in student success. The rubric included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence of student achievement beyond expectations on state or national tests, where this evidence exists.</li>\n<li>Principals' exemplary reputations in the community and/or school system. This could be gained through consultation with system personnel or other principals, school inspection reports, and so forth.</li>\n<li>Other indicators of success that are context-specific, such as the overall reputation of the school, awards for exemplary programs, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout the study, principals from varying countries and schools were interviewed. Common threads were discovered when it came to answering the question- what makes these leaders and schools particularly successful? Some highlights that stood out for me included shared leadership, high expectations, trust, and transparency; I have always believed people-centered aspects of leadership were important without data like this to support my opinion. Gurr (2017) pointed out that these influential principals are student-centered \"Above all else, they are driven by the desire to provide the best educational environment they can for all students\" (p.5). What was particularly interesting was Gurr's (2017) finding that both transformational and instructional leadership were equally valued.</p>\n<p><strong>How can this better inform our practice?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that research such as this can help us define what makes a great principal or leader of a school. It can support future and potential leaders to reflect on their practice and determine if they can exhibit some or even many of the qualities that have been listed in this study. However, while there are many commonalities between the leadership models and some of the schools, there were obvious differences that occurred depending on the time, the initiatives, the people, and the school's needs. Essentially, the context in leadership was an essential factor in a principal's success. The context was evident in Indonesia, where the values of the community played a part in success- including the idea that they were \"entrusted by God\" and in Singapore, where the concept of knowing oneself was significant. These small samples serve as an important reminder for those wishing to be principals in cultures outside of our own. The values of countries and cultures will vary; therefore, leaders need to understand and try to gain a deeper understanding of the culture within which they choose to work. Differing cultural norms are undoubtedly apparent to me while living in China. Approaches that work well with western colleagues, like speaking directly about a topic, do not always translate well to a culture where \"saving face\" is inherent for some. It is also a constant reminder for leaders to remember to keep our students at the center of all that we do; however, it seems to achieve this, that we need to cultivate the trust and leadership of the school in which we are working.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Gurr, D.

One clear recommendation was the idea of adapting a curriculum\nthat is “…relevant, flexible and responsive to needs” (p. 17). The report recognizes that we\nlive in a world that aligns its curriculum with privilege and certain types of knowledge. The\nreport highlights the bias in many curriculums within rural and urban areas, the use of\ntextbooks, and the effect of language use in schools. Therefore, it is of utmost importance\nthat we examine our 21st\n-century curriculum and work to find a way that it can adapt to our\never-changing world. One way we might be able to mitigate some of the biases is to embrace\na more inquiry, concepts, and skills-based focus over simply delivering content that might not\napply to all.</p>\n<p><strong>Part I: The Problem</strong></p>\n<p>With the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, education practices changed at a rapid pace.\nTeachers and students went from attending school in a traditional bricks-and-mortar setting to\nteaching remotely in an online environment. This massive shift served as an important\nreminder that it might be time to examine some of the traditional practices we may use in our\neveryday classrooms. At the same time, it served as an essential reminder of the inequity\nwithin the educational system today. Hampson et al. (2021) point out that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As children grow older, they become less and less engaged in school – when one would hope that the reverse would be true. And this is a bigger problem for the most disadvantaged students, who consistently show lower levels of engagement. (Para. 3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, it becomes the job of educators to find innovative solutions to engage all of our\nstudents regardless of wealth or status. The Global Risk Report 2022 re-iterates that COVID -\n19 has damaged the social cohesion in countries to detrimental levels and perceived it as a critical threat that will damage our world. The report highlights that over the next ten years,\nthe lack of social cohesion will cause more significant disparity and inequality that will affect\nthe \"-economic, political, technological, and intergenerational- generational—which was\nalready challenging societies even before income disparities increased through the pandemic.\nThese disparities are now expected to widen further” (p.16).</p>\n<p>The world has changed. Over the past three years, students have been irrevocably\nchanged by the onset of COVID-19, which leaves us in a complex world with many\nproblems. Learning that may have been applicable or relevant in the past does not always\napply today. If we want to create problem- solvers who will address the issues we are facing\ntoday, then we must address what we teach our children in schools. Erickson (2011) points\nout that we live in a world that has moved from national to global. We have problems that\nneed solving on an international level from environmental, climate change, immigration and\nemigration, conflicts with no resolutions, health problems, and the list continues to grow. The\nskills that may have been required in the past are almost no longer applicable in today's\nglobalized world.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the time for change is upon us. In this increasingly globalized\nworld, we need to teach our students to identify problems in the world and then begin to try\nand determine solutions. There is an argument that using an inquiry, concept, and skills-based\ncurriculum would be a worthy goal for our schools today. Instead of focusing on content,\nwhy not imagine a curriculum that uses concepts and skills to drive the curriculum?\nAccording to Yarim et al. (2012) “In multi-stakeholder learning environments students are\nargued to profit from being involved in real world transdisciplinary projects on multiple\nscales, bridging the science-society gap, and applying various approaches and methods for\nfacing complex problems” (as cited in Oonk, p. 5, 2016). Therefore, if we focused on inquiry,\nskills and concepts, we may be addressing the problems of inequality or content that is not\napplicable to different groups. Problems that are happening in China will certainly differ\nfrom those that are happening in Turkey, or perhaps not, but let us begin to involve our\nstudents in the process. Hampson et al. (2020) maintain that with the introduction of\ntechnology, there is no reason that each child cannot tailor their learning to a more\npersonalized and relevant way. The role of passion learning is meant to engage learners to\npursue whatever they are interested. This independent inquiry leads to the greater\nengagement that we want for our students.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Relevance</strong></p>\n<p>Balim (2016) created a study posited that inquiry or discovery-based learning affected\nacademic achievement, scores of retention of learning, and perception of inquiry learning\nskills scores, both on cognitive and affective levels. This evidence helps to confirm what\nsome educators have always believed about the role of inquiry, concepts and skills in\neducation. As an International Baccalaureate (IB)- Middle Years Programme (MYP) teacher\nsince 2005, the belief in the mission and aims of the IB have helped to guide my passion for\ninquiry and concept-based learning. Their mission states, “The International Baccalaureate\naims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a\nbetter and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect” (p. 3). As\nsomeone who has developed units of inquiry based on this philosophy, I have had the\nopportunity to see first-hand the difference that inquiry, skills, and concept-based learning\ncan have on students. One such instance occurred in Ho Chi- Minh, Vietnam, in 2014, where\na Grade 8 class created a KWL chart regarding Iran. The class completed some research on\nthe country prior to reading Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis. One student raised his hand and\nasked, \"What I really want to know is how can one person influence so many others?” This\nkind of deep thinking and questioning is vital in our world. Couldn't this question apply to a\nvariety of situations in history to today?</p>\n<p>As someone who strives to lead with compassion and care, this is the time to examine\nour curriculum and see how we can make it relevant to all learners regardless of where they\nare, who they are, or how much money they have. As Abdullahi (2010) pointed out, \"In the\ntwenty-first century, global educators deal with issues and problems caused by poverty,\nglobalization, global terrorism, and human and ecological abuses\" (p.24). There is no doubt\nthat the last couple of years have been a challenge. We should continue educating children to\nbe positive citizens and problem solvers worldwide. To help parents understand that good\ngrades are great but being a good person is even better. As the IB points out in its mission, let\nus use our education curriculum to support our children \"…to become active, compassionate\nand lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be\nright” (p. 3).</p>\n<p><strong>Significance of the Problem</strong></p>\n<p>There are many facets to this problem. We are interested in aligning the curriculum to be\nmore inquiry, concepts, and skills-based. At the same time, we want an inclusive, engaging\ncurriculum that allows students to become solutions focused on the problems we are facing in\nour world today. Wagner (2008) highlights this idea with his look at what he calls the\n\"Global Achievement Gap,\" which is essentially the disconnect between what is taught in\nschool and what students need to learn to succeed in our world today. These include critical\nthinking, communication, collaboration, curiosity, and adaptability. Wagner (2007) highlights\nthe lack of real-world application in our current classrooms, and it is leading to the \"gap\" in\nstudent achievement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These issues were never discussed in any of the classrooms I observed. Some teachers I talked to wanted to have such conversations with their students. However, they felt obligated to spend all available class time covering the content needed to ensure that the students would pass various standardized tests (p. xvi).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this way, the promotion of inclusivity occurs because we are not necessarily teaching the\ncontent, instead, educators can focus on the concepts or skills. An example of this might be in\na history class; traditionally, a U.S. history class may linearly align itself beginning with\nWorld War I. In a concept-based programme such as the IB- MYP, the teacher may begin\nwith the concept of conflict. They might look at this concept through the lens of a Global\nExploration of justice, peace, and conflict management or power and privilege. In the U.S.\nthey could undoubtedly use World War I as the content that aligns with the concept;\nhowever, any country in the world could use the concept and Global Exploration to explore\ncontent that might be more pertinent or pressing to explore in their classrooms. At the same\ntime, this allows students to analyse conflict. Instead of simply regurgitating and memorizing\nfacts, they can look at the problem, figure out what happened, and then begin to connect to\ntheir own lives and the world around them. In turn, this may help them find real-world\nsolutions to conflicts in our world today. A concept-based curriculum does not mean that\nthere is no content; however, it means that the curriculum is no longer beholden to the\ncontent but instead driven by the concepts. A concept-based curriculum is certainly not a new\nidea. Piaget and Vygotsky (1936) related this idea directly to constructive learning theory, the\nidea that learning is an active process that students need to play their part (as cited in ). It\ncannot be passive but rather must be what Miller (2012) refers to as “transformative” (p.12).\nThe time is ripe for us to make a change in our curriculum. We can no longer use a contentbased curriculum that does not serve the needs of the 21st\n-century learner. COVID-19 should\nserve as a time for educational reform.</p>\n<p><strong>Part II: Emergent Innovation</strong></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that technology has changed the face of education. There is no need\nfor students to spend hours poring over the library card catalogue to find information about a\ntopic they want to research. Instead, today's students can find and access any information\nthey want with the click of a mouse. The advent of memorizing facts and then repeating them\nfor a quiz or test is only one way a student can showcase their knowledge. Wathall (2022), a\nconcept-based educator states that,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An explicit instruction method is a teacher-centered approach that often adopts a cycle of explaining, modelling, scaffolding and practising. I facetiously call this the monkey see monkey do technique. This transmission method of teaching stifles a learner’s ability to think independently, to be curious and creative (para. 4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, technology can be essential in changing our curriculum and end goals. If, as\neducators, we know that students can access any information they are interested in, then it\nstands to reason that we have a responsibility to teach students the skills needed to evaluate\nsources. At the same time, ensure that the information they are reading is credible. In this day\nof \"fake\" news, now more than ever, we need to teach solid research skills (see figure 1). In\nthe IB- MYP these skills are called the Approaches to Learning. The Research Cluster\nincludes a section on media literacy that is relevant to students today.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 503px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 48.484848484848484%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/bc840e0fa47489550486cd8460a1e1d9/c9b55/figure-1.webp 165w,\n/static/bc840e0fa47489550486cd8460a1e1d9/f2908/figure-1.webp 330w,\n/static/bc840e0fa47489550486cd8460a1e1d9/4ef2a/figure-1.webp 503w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/bc840e0fa47489550486cd8460a1e1d9/04c57/figure-1.png 165w,\n/static/bc840e0fa47489550486cd8460a1e1d9/d9ecf/figure-1.png 330w,\n/static/bc840e0fa47489550486cd8460a1e1d9/a4078/figure-1.png 503w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/bc840e0fa47489550486cd8460a1e1d9/a4078/figure-1.png\"\n            alt=\"Figure 1\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If students can create their questions, determine their learning or even participate in guidedinquiry, we allow them the opportunity to become agents of their learning who feel\nempowered. In turn, they can feel the joy from investigating what matters to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementing Change</strong></p>\n<p>For a change to occur in curriculum and education today, we would need a drastic rethink of what is valued in education today. With the advent of standardized testing, we would\nneed to move away from this kind of assessment and convince our stakeholders of the value\nof inquiry, concepts, and skills. Changing to an inquiry model can play a role in creating\ncritical thinkers and problem solvers. At the same time helping to address inclusivity issues\nwithin the curriculum. Change in education is arduous and long since this idea of promoting\ninquiry over content is not new or novel, Taba (1932) stated,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The task of education, as understood at present, is to lead growing individuals to more and more intelligent, wide, well-organized, and rich forms of experience through guidance, through selection of subject matter, and by providing an environment which is stimulating to self-direction (as cited in Laanemets &#x26; Kalamees-Ruubel, 2013).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Ontario, Canada, the Ministry of Education (2020) began using social-emotional learning\nskills in the teaching of mathematics. The idea is that students will “develop confidence, cope\nwith challenges and think critically\" (para. 3). Unfortunately, the current governmental\nadministration found this method to be unacceptable and demanded that the curriculum return\nto “back to basics.” Back to Basics meant returning to how the curriculum was taught before\nwith drills, facts, and memorization. Therefore, before we can convince the relevant\nstakeholders, politicians, teachers, administrators, and parents, we need more research and\ndata to support the idea that this is a better way for student learning. We need data like\nScruggs and Mastropieri (2009) who found that “when using inquiry-based learning in place\nof a textbook approach in two science units, high school special needs students yielded\nsignificantly higher achievement than their peers who used a textbook” (as cited in Caswell\n&#x26; LaBrie, p. 17, 2017).</p>\n<p>Although implementing change is challenging as Patterson (2016) points out “Change\nhas long been the most feared aspect of education. Regardless of its inevitability, each time\nit’s met with the same disdain and hesitance as the last” (para.4). It is not entirely impossible.\nWith the advent of data-informed decision-making, there is undoubtedly room to start the\nconversation for change within the curriculum. According to the IBO “there were over 7,500\nprogrammes being offered worldwide, across over 5,500 schools in 160 countries\" (para. 1).\nThere has also been a growth of schools by 33% since 2016. Since the IB offers an inquiry,\nconcepts, and skills-based programme, it does provide some hope.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50.303030303030305%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/fe76a39e316d240668705b5cc07cc349/c9b55/figure-2.webp 165w,\n/static/fe76a39e316d240668705b5cc07cc349/f2908/figure-2.webp 330w,\n/static/fe76a39e316d240668705b5cc07cc349/e88ff/figure-2.webp 600w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/fe76a39e316d240668705b5cc07cc349/04c57/figure-2.png 165w,\n/static/fe76a39e316d240668705b5cc07cc349/d9ecf/figure-2.png 330w,\n/static/fe76a39e316d240668705b5cc07cc349/0a47e/figure-2.png 600w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/fe76a39e316d240668705b5cc07cc349/0a47e/figure-2.png\"\n            alt=\"Figure 2\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Another change that would be an easy fix would be to rid the world of standardized testing.\nHigh-stakes testing has certainly proven to be detrimental to students' emotional health and\nwell-being. Minarechová's research (2012) showed that tests were being used to hold schools\naccountable. Unfortunately, in doing so, there were many problems for students that\nnegatively manifested, such as \"…stress and tension in students, teachers’ preferences for\n“better” students, undermining of student self-esteem and in some cases even student fear of\nfailure and the associated consequences” (p. 10).</p>\n<p>If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it is that we do not need end-of-the-year exams to\ndetermine a child's future or measure their success as a human being. The IB and IGSCE\ncancelled exams in 2020 and then again in 2022 in China. Kumari (2020) the Director of the\nIB stated, \"We felt reassured that universities already have a deep understanding of our\nrigorous programs and know how well we prepare our students to continue their education at\nthose institutions\" (para. 15). This statement only serves to exemplify why there is no need\nfor high stakes testing. Since we know that the IB's foundation is built on inquiry, concepts\nand skills, it only serves to reason that this framework is enough for students to succeed as\nthey move forward in our world. However, it does not entirely solve the idea of equity in\neducation. It simply allows for a more inclusive education curriculum that could be relevant\nand accessible to all. Unfortunately, the IBO is expensive, again highlighting inequity in\neducation. Therefore, Ministries of Education would have to model themselves on the IBO\nand create their versions of inquiry, concepts and skills-based learning. Not every child has a\ncomputer or access to technology, so while it can spend its time connecting us, it can also tear\nus apart. Simmon's (2020) describes how equity has been highlighted even more during the\npandemic, “Some districts have provided children tablets, but there are still far too many\nstudents without the necessary tools for distance learning, including reliable internet service”\n(para.5). So, teaching media- research skills to children without a computer becomes a\nchallenge. At the same time; however, we can still teach research skills. These are still of\nutmost importance.</p>\n<p>In theory, teachers’ professional development can be dedicated to learning how to\ninstitute inquiry into their classrooms. Again, with the advent of technology, courses and\nprofessional development can be acquired online. Money for teacher training would have to\nbecome a priority. Andrini (2016) states that \"In carrying out their duties professionally,\nteachers need a steady and complete insight about teaching and learning activities. A teacher\nmust have an overall picture of how the process of teaching and learning that occurs and what\nsteps are necessary so that teaching tasks can be performed well. (p. 4).</p>\n<p>To implement such change would require a long-term strategic plan. With the onset of\nmore and more countries becoming nationalistic, it may be harder to get an agreement\nbetween countries on what is best for student learning. The Global Risk Report (2022)\nhighlighted that \"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the shortcomings of global cooperation”\n(p. 21). The report also stated that there is a need for global efforts to be made because the\nproblems and challenges highlighted, such as climate change, rapid digitalization, the space\nrace, migration, etc., cannot be solved by national governments alone. Now more than ever,\nwe need to stay connected. Now more than ever, we need to help our students to become\ncritical thinkers who can help to solve the issues that our world is facing today.</p>\n<p><strong>Part III</strong></p>\n<p>The long-term effects of creating an inclusive curriculum based on inquiry, concepts,\nand skills can help address some of the problems that the Global Education Monitoring\nReport highlights. If we agree that,disadvantaged groups are kept out or pushed out of\neducation systems through more or less subtle decisions leading to exclusion from curricula,\nirrelevant learning objectives, stereotyping in textbooks, discrimination in resource allocation\nand assessments, tolerance of violence and neglect of needs (p.10).</p>\n<p>Then we can certainly solve some of these problems with a change in a more inclusive\ncurriculum. Let us refer to the mission of the IBO (2020) again, which highlights that \"others\nwith their differences can also be right\" (para. 2). Following a framework that is based on\ninquiry allows for the flexibility that is required in our ever-changing and evolving world.\nThe IB- MYP does not recommend the use of textbooks for the very reason that they are\nusually outdated and often regional in their publications. With inquiry, teachers can also\nensure that the learning objectives are relevant and meaningful to the student body. Rather\nthan teaching the content, teachers can teach the concepts and skills that a students will need\nas they progress through school. Educators can create relevant and authentic material that\nchildren care about and, in turn, inspire the love of learning that we wish to instill in our\nstudents. McTighe &#x26; Silver (2020) point out, \"The rapid changes and unpredictability of the\nmodern world call for learners who will be able to transfer their learning.”</p>\n<p>According to the Global Monitoring Education Report (2020), we live in a world that\nstruggles to be inclusive. Everything begins with education. It is time to create a curriculum\nthat will address the diverse needs of each learner. A curriculum that is relevant to the\nchanging face of our world today. That does not rely on tradition but can move forward openminded and positive for every student, no matter their background. This could start with an\ninquiry, concept and skills-driven curriculum. The IB- MYP programme is one such\ncurriculum that genuinely believes in this philosophy. Whether we adopt the MYP or a\nsimilar type of curriculum, it is undeniable that the aim is to create students who are</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>active learners and internationally minded young people who can empathize with others and pursue lives of purpose and meaning. The programme empowers students to inquire into a wide range of issues and ideas of significance locally, nationally, and globally. The result is young people who are creative, critical, and reflective thinkers (para 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This description embodies the world citizens we want to see facing the challenges of the 21st\ncentury. It is time to equip our students with the skills that are needed. Therefore, there is no\ntime like the present to begin this journey toward curriculum change.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Abdullahi, S.A. (2010).
